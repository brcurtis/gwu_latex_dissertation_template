\section{Example 1}
% Example 1
\ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
 e = m \cdot c^2 \; ,
\end{equation}
which is at the same time the most widely known
and the least well understood physical formula.

A reference to this subsection \label{sec:this} 
looks like: ``see Section~\ref{sec:this}. on
Page~\pageref{sec:this}.''


\section{Example 2}
% Example 2
\ldots from which follows Kirchhoffs current law:
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
\end{equation}


Kirchhoffs€™ voltage law can be derived \ldots

\section{Example 3}
% Example 3
\ldots which has several advantages.

\begin{equation}
 I_D = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very different transistor model. \ldots

This is an example of a footnote\footnote{This word has medieval origins.} .
I like to catch fluke\footnote{The fluke is also known as the summer flounder.} at the Jersey Shore .
