\indent This is an example of organizational headers. Start each new chapter on a
new page. Chapter headings will be centered, in bold, and in all caps or initial
caps. \\
\indent Leave a space after the chapter heading before starting the text. That is
different from the lower level headings. After second and lower level headings,
start the text on the next line. You do not have to have text immediately following
a chapter heading. You can go right in to the next sub-heading. After lower level
headings, you should have text before the next lower heading level.
